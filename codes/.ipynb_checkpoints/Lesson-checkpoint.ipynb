As you may have guessed already, the goal is to choose the fastest route... or deduce and build a better one, or even *the best route* ! Does it exist?

It is a slightly less abstract quantity, which pictures the **process of converting this energy into motion via application of a force** (the snake probably slightly bites its tail here). Energy can therefore be seen as a kind of elusive quantity which only manifests itself via multiple and indirect ways : kinetic energy of a moving object, potential energy stored by an object's position in a gravitationnal field, thermal energy due to an object's temperature, ... In physics, energy is postulated as **conserved**, and simply transfers from one form to another.\n",

When the weights are released, they briefly transfer all their energy into the projectile via the trebuchet arm. The projectile briefly undergo a huge force (some **work**), which accelerates it. Some of the initial potential energy of the weights are now present in the form of kinetic energy for the projectile. The rest of the energy is transferred elsewhere during the shot via frictions and heat in the trebuchet structure. \n",

The derivation of those relations are left for an other story. Now remember the postulate of energy conservation : the parcel **total** energy (potential+kinetic) is constant along the rail.

    "Now, imagine a different situation as pictured below. Beetween you and your igloo, there is a long strip of mud land going from far ouest to far east. You are slower in the mud, as you have to push the sleigh yourself. As a consequence, you are a little bit delayed. What is your tactic to minimise the time of travel compared to going straight toward your igloo? Do you have an intuition of what to do? \n",
