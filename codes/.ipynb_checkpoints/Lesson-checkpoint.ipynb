As you may have guessed already, the goal is to choose the fastest route... or deduce and build a better one, or even *the best route* ! Does it exist? And if so, does it depends on the mass of the object? Well, answers will follow.

You can use the help of the animation above to observe what's going on.\n",

    "  - Although the **straight** line is the **shortest** distant, is it by far the **slowest**. The trajectory a rough compromise between going toward Bonogonzo's island and going down to gain speed, and clearly, success is not there. The package looses too much time at the beginning.\n",
    "  - On the contrary, the first instants on the **steep** curve are spent going down as fast as possible to gain speed, then use these speed to go right and reach destination.\n",
    "  - item Finally, the **deep** curve chooses to go rather deeply, maximising the velocity for a moment, before reaching Bonogonzo's island. This last approach is actually the **fastest**.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have our intuitive solution! The curve which is the fastest should find a **compromise between reaching high speed by going down, while still spending some time going toward B's island**. Keep in mind that this is only a intuitive solution. We do not know the exact relation between the height and the speed. Intuitions in physics are generally a good starting point, but don't get too much sentimentaly attached to them. Sometimes they can be completely misleading and prevent us from moving forward.\n",

    "\n",
    "Enough talking, here is a second question for you : is the mass of the package important for the path design of the rails? (remember, we can neglect all loss of speed due to friction).\n",

    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "> **In the vacuum, the speed of an object in free fall is independent of its mass**\n",

    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a similar conclusion arises when considering one of the fundamental postulate of modern physics: **energy conservation**. Knowing that the energy of a parcel is constant along the rails, and that it is equal to the sum of its kinetic and potential energy, $E_k$ and $E_p$ respectively, can you show why the absolute speed $v$ at anytime during the descent does not depend on its mass $m$, and depends only on the height $y$ of the parcel from the ground? (well supposed there is a ground of course, nobody ever saw it from the city, many legends exists...)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In physics, the concept of an object's **energy** is very abstract. It serves to quantify the capability of this object to do some **work**. Well, what is **work** then? It is a slightly less abstract quantity, which pictures the **process of converting this energy into motion via application of a force** (the snake probably slightly bites its tail here). Energy can therefore be seen as a kind of elusive quantity which only manifests itself via multiple and indirect ways : kinetic energy of a moving object, potential energy stored by an object's position in a gravitationnal field, thermal energy due to an object's temperature, ... In physics, energy is postulated as **conserved**, and simply transfers from one form to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A simple example is the trebuchet, which is an other way to send \"gifts\". As the counter-weights are manually levered, they accumulate gravitationnal potential energy. When the weights are released, they briefly transfer all their energy into the projectile via the trebuchet arm. The projectile briefly undergo a huge force, which accelerates it. Some of the initial potential energy of the weights are now present in the form of kinetic energy for the projectile. The rest of the energy is transferred elsewhere during the shot via frictions and heat. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The kinetic energy is proportional to the object's mass as well as the square of its speed $v$, and reads $\\displaystyle E_k=\\frac{m v^2}2$. While the potential $E_p=m g y$ is again proportionnal to its mass in addition to its vertical position $y$, where $g\\simeq 10 \\,\\text{m/s}^2$ is the free fall acceleration of any object on this planet (considered as constant locally). The derivation of those relations are left for an other story. Now remember the postulate of energy conservation : the parcel **total** energy (potential+kinetic) is constant along the rail. Therefore, as it looses some potential energy, it should acquire equivalently some kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remember that nobody has ever seen the ground? Well then, what is the heigh $y$ of the parcel in that case? Simple, choose it! **Let choose Akara's island as the \"ground level\"**, such that the **initial vertical position of the package is zero**,  $y=y_A=0$, with $y_A$ Akara's island vertical position. Bonogonzo's island vertical position will therefore be negative, $y_B<0$.\n",

    "    Now, write down and simplify the **initial energy $E_A$** of the parcel when it has not yet moved from A's island (located at height $y_A$), then equate it with the energy of the parcel $E$ when it is at any other height $y$. You should find a relation between the speed $v$ and the vertical position $y$.\n",

    "\n",

    "    E_A &= E_{k,A} + E_{p,A}  = 0 + mgy_A &\\text{(initial total energy of the parcel on A's island, it's kinetic energy is null)}\\nonumber\\\\\n",
