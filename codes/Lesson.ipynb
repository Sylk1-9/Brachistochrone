And if so, does it depends on the mass of the object? Well, answers will follow.

    "1. In physics, the concept of an object's **energy** is very abstract. It serves to quantify the capability of this object to do some **work**. Well, what is **work**? It is a slightly less abstract quantity, which pictures the **process of converting this energy into motion via application of a force** (the snake probably slightly bites its tail here). Energy can therefore be seen as a kind of elusive quantity which manifest it's via multiple way : kinetic energy of a moving object, potential energy stored by an object's position in a gravitationnal field, thermal energy due to an object's temperature, ... It is alway conserve, and simply transfers from one form to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A simple example is the trebuchet, which is an other way to send \"gifts\". As the counter-weights are manually levered, they accumulate gravitationnal potential energy. When the weights are released, they briefly transfer all their energy into the projectile via the trebuchet arm. The projectile briefly undergo a huge force, which accelerates it. Some of the initial potential energy of the weights are now present in the form of kinetic energy for the projectile. The rest of the energy is transferred elsewhere during the shot via frictions and heat. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In our problem, it is **the own potential energy of the faling object which is converted into kinetic energy**.\n",

    "2. The kinetic energy is proportional to the quare of an object's speed $v$, and reads $\\displaystyle E_k=\\frac{m v^2}2$. While the potential $E_p=m g y$ is proportionnal to it vertical position $y$, where $g\\simeq 10 \\,\\text{m/s}^2$ is the free fall acceleration of any object on this planet (considered as constant locally). Now remember the postulate of energy conservation : the parcel **total** energy (potential+kinetic) is constant along the rail. Therefore, as it looses some potential energy, it should acquire equivalently some kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remember that nobody has ever see the ground? Well then, what is the heigh $y$ of the parcel in that case? Simple, choose it! **Let choose Akara's house as the \"ground level\"**, such that the **initial vertical position of the package is zero**,  $y=y_A=0$, with $y_A$ Akara's house vertical position. Bun's house vertical position will therefore be negatif, $y_B<0$.\n",
